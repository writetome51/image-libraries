Any form <input> that self-validates during its 'blur' event is an instance of
AppValidatingFormInputComponent.  AppValidatingFormInputComponent depends on the interface
ValidatingInput (npm package @writetome51/validating-inputs).  ValidatingInput only represents an
input of type 'text', 'password', or 'number'.
