Directives are classes providing UI content behavior.  Each has an assigned selector
(a custom element or element attribute).

Components are subclasses of Directives.  They represent UI content and/or provide its
behavior.  Each has an assigned html template.

Services are helpers that are injected into Directives, Components, or other Services
(though some are static and don't need to be injected).  Each has a specific purpose.
They are often used as singletons shared among multiple Directives, Components, and/or
other Services.

Modules contain Components, Directives, Services, and other Modules.
Directives and Components must be declared in a module's 'declarations' array.  This
makes them belong to that module.  If you want to use those Directives or Components in
other modules, you must list them in their module's 'exports' array, and import their
module into the destination module by listing it in the destination module's 'imports'
array.
