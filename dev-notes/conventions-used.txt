Each instance of a Service class is referred to without the word 'service' at the end.

Each class/object used as a data structure is named with 'Data' at the end, and their filenames end
with '.data.ts'.

'data processing' is any data manipulation that requires the user to wait for a result.

Any UI button Component that initiates data processing is a subclass of
StartDataProcessContainerComponent.

'data transport processing' refers to any data processing that involves sending the data to an
external resource that returns a result.  All processing of this kind is handled by subclasses of
DataTransportProcessorService.

Any use of the word 'Load' is referring to the total number of images the app is configured to
have stored in the browser at once.  For example, ImagesRestAPIService.getAllLoad() retrieves N
of all a user's images, where N is the load size.

The name of any variable or constant referencing a Subscribable (from Rxjs) ends with a '$'.


Path aliases: import statements that use a path beginning with '@' are aliases.  They're
defined in {project-root}/tsconfig.json.
