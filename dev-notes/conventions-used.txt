Filenames follow the naming convention Angular recommends for Modules, Components,
Directives, Services, and etc. (the different Angular entities).


Directory names

Inside /src/app/, a directory that contains an entity and all the assets used only in
that entity will be named after that entity, matching its filename (except underscores are
used instead of periods and the extension name is omitted).  Example: a directory
containing  add-images.component.ts  and its assets is named 'add-images_component'.


Services

Each instance of a Service is referred to without 'Service' at the end.


Data Structures

Each class/object used as a data structure is named with 'Data' at the end, and their
filenames end with '.data.ts'.
Any reference to one of these data structures is named without 'Data' at the end.


Interfaces

The names of all files that define interfaces end with '.interface.ts'.


Abstract Class file names

Any abstract Angular entities have 'abstract' in their file names like so:
'example.abstract.component.ts'
'example.abstract.service.ts'


Usage of the word 'Process'

'Process' refers to an entire cycle of these steps:
1. Getting an initial result from some kind of action.
2. Checking that result for errors and, if any, executing tasks based on those errors.
3. If no errors, executing tasks based on the successful result.

'Process' is used in the names of Services that run a process.
Those Services follow this naming convention: `Process{Action}Service`.
Examples:
ProcessDbOperationService runs a process that involves interaction with a database, and
its {Action} is 'DbOperation'.
ProcessLoginByPasswordService has the {Action} 'LoginByPassword'.


Usage of the words 'Execute' and 'Executor'

'Execute' refers to running ANY code.  It could be a process, or something much simpler.
'Executor' refers to a Service that runs an execution.


Load

Any use of the word 'load' is referring to the total pieces of data (each 'piece'
most likely being an object) the app is allowed to have stored in the browser at once.
For example, AllUserImages.getLoad() retrieves N of all a user's images, where N is the
load size.


Subscribables (Observables, from Rxjs)

The name of any variable or constant referencing a Subscribable ends with '$'.


Path Aliases (paths that begin with '@')

Aliases to files created in this project are defined in  /tsconfig.json.


Label

The word 'label' is the preferred way of specifying a name for display.


Commented-out Import Statements

Some files have some imports commented out.  This is because that entity being
imported is not actually used but is referred to in a comment somewhere.  Example:

// import { ImageDBRecord } from './image-db-record.interface';

export interface LibraryDBRecord {

	// Foreign keys, each relating to `ImageDBRecord._id`  <----
	_image_ids: string[];

}
