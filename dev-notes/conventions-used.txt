The name of any variable or constant referencing a Subscribable (from Rxjs) ends with a '$'.

Each class/object used as a data structure (with limited behavior or no behavior) is named with
'Data' at the end, and their filenames end with '.data.ts'.

'data processing' is any data manipulation that requires the user to wait for a result.

Any UI button component that initiates data processing is a subclass of StartDataProcessComponent.

'data transport processing' refers to any data processing that involves sending the data to an
external resource that returns a result.  All processing of this kind is handled by subclasses of
DataTransportProcessorService.

Any form <input> that self-validates during its 'blur' event is an instance of
ValidatingInputComponent.  ValidatingInputComponent depends on the interface ValidatingInput (npm
package @writetome51/validating-inputs).  ValidatingInput only represents an input of type
'text', 'password', or 'number'.
