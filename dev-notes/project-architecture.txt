Most Modules in this project are instantiated via lazy-loading, which in Angular happens via
accessing the Module's route in the url.

Any class used in more than one Module is found in  src/app/shared.


Any form <input> that self-validates during its 'blur' event is an instance of
AppValidatingFormInputComponent.  AppValidatingFormInputComponent depends on the
interface ValidatingInput (npm package @writetome51/validating-inputs).
ValidatingInput only represents an input of type 'text', 'password', or 'number'.
