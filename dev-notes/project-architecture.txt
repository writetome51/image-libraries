Many Angular Modules in this project are instantiated via lazy-loading (by including the
Module's route in the requested url).  These Modules are found in
/src/app/routed-modules.


Any entity (class, interface, constant, etc.) used in multiple independent Modules is
found in src/app/shared.


Any form <input> that self-validates during its 'blur' event is an instance of
AppValidatingFormInputComponent.  AppValidatingFormInputComponent depends on the
interface ValidatingInput (npm package @writetome51/validating-inputs).
ValidatingInput only represents an input of type 'text', 'password', or 'number'.


A Module may use Services that are only used in that Module.  Usually that Module ——
let's call it ExampleModule —— will import a Module called ExampleServicesModule, and
those Services will have their @Injectable decorator written as:
@Injectable({providedIn: ExampleServicesModule})


Any class decorator I've created is an experiment.
