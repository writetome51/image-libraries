Many Angular Modules in this project are instantiated via lazy-loading, which in
Angular happens by including the Module's route in the url.  These Modules are found in
/src/app/routed-modules.

Any entity (class, interface, constant, etc.) used in more than one Module is found in
src/app/shared.

Any form <input> that self-validates during its 'blur' event is an instance of
AppValidatingFormInputComponent.  AppValidatingFormInputComponent depends on the
interface ValidatingInput (npm package @writetome51/validating-inputs).
ValidatingInput only represents an input of type 'text', 'password', or 'number'.

Any custom class decorator I've created is an experiment.
