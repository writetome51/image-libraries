Conventions:
If a class method is referred to here by writing ClassName.method(), this is not implying
that the method is static. This convention refers to any method belonging to that class.

AlertService is app-wide alert message service.  AlertService is assigned a message by other services.
AlertService only contains the alert message text.  AlertComponent displays it to user.  The
AlertComponent is only used by AppComponent.

Any data processing that requires sending/receiving data over http is handled by
DataOperationProcessorService.  DataOperationProcessorService.process() calls
DataOperationProcessorService._getResult(), and passes the result to
ResultInterpreterService.interpret(result).  This checks if the result contains an error message, and
if so, the appropriate error handler is called.  If no error, the result is passed to
ResultProcessorService.process(result).
