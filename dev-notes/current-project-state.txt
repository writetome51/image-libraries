At some point in the last month, refactoring Components caused some styling to break,
especially in any Component where you view a page of images.  The styling in
ImageActionMenuComponent is completely screwed.  The width of form text inputs has shrunk.

The problem from the previous entry is solved.  The fix was made by combining multiple
stylesheets into one file.  Previously they'd been separated into as many as 7 files, and
the config file /angular.json had been told to bundle them together during the build.
That had worked until I updated Angular to version 11, which (for unknown reasons) doesn't
allow the config file to bundle more than 3 or 4 stylesheet files together (so some of the
styles weren't being included).
