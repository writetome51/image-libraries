All successful responses to the API return a JSON string.

It's a private API.  Each request requires you submit a 'secret'.
Each request requires that you try to connect with a user account (except for 'create-user').
Each user record in the db has a 'loggedIn' attribute that, if false, will cause most API
requests to result in error.

The only requests to the API that can be successful when not logged in are:

GET request to 'user-exists'.
PATCH request to 'user-login'.
POST request to 'create-user'.

When login is successful, the db updates these attributes in the user's record:
'loggedIn', 'lastLoggedIn', 'sessionID'.
