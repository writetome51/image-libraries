Hover-functionality should be on, and when hovering on any image, action menu should appear
under it and give choice 'add to library' (with submenu letting you choose what library).
(deadline Sept 19)


Todo: implement multiple-image selection mode inside /all-images route.  When this mode is on,
toggle-selecting images should be activated, hover-functionality should be off, and app action menu
should give choices like 'delete selected' or 'add selected to library' (with submenu letting you choose
 what library). (deadline July 21)


Todo: add a screen-capture youtube video to home page showing how to use the site. Video must show
examples of doing most things, i.e., creating account, adding images and image urls, creating a library,
adding images to library, re-arranging images, and editing image metadata, such as location.
