My Rest API is built using MongoDB Realm (formerly Stitch).  MongoDB provides a Realm Web
SDK for programmatically communicating with your Realm app.  A year ago I tried using the
Stitch web SDK and it didn't work (was never sure why), which is why i ended up
creating the Rest API to communicate with Realm entirely using http webhooks.  But using
webhooks hasn't been seamless because i've had to use a CORS proxy, which occasionally
slows requests, and sometimes (on Sundays usually) doesn't respond at all.  So today I'm
going to try some tests using the Realm SDK from inside this app.

Realm Web SDK works well.  Switching to that.  Not using Rest API any more.

By far the hardest thing about this whole process is deciding where to put a piece of
code.  I suppose that's what system architecture is:  specifically defining what
class/module/whatever should be in charge of what code and making it easy to find things.
