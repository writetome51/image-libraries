My Rest Api is built using MongoDB Realm (formerly Stitch).  MongoDB provides a Realm Web SDK for
programmatically communicating with your Realm app.  A year ago I tried using the Stitch web SDK and
 it didn't work (was never sure why), which is why i ended up creating the Rest API to communicate
 with Realm entirely using http webhooks.  But using webhooks hasn't been seamless because i've had
 to use a CORS proxy, which occasionally slows requests, and sometimes (on Sundays usually) doesn't
 respond at all.  So today I'm going to try some tests using the Realm SDK from inside this app.

Realm Web SDK works well.  Switching to that.  Not using Rest API any more.
