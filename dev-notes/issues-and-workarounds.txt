Custom TypeScript Decorators

If you combine your own custom decorator(s) with @Injectable() decorator, Angular's dependency
injector won't work.  The solution is detailed in src/app/injectable-decorator-workaround.ts. and is
used as a convention in the app.

Any custom typescript decorators created by calling getClassModificationDecorator() have been
pre-transpiled into javascript files.  This is done to avoid an Angular build error which says
'Function calls are not supported in decorators...'.
