Custom TypeScript Decorators

If you combine your own custom decorator(s) with @Injectable() decorator, Angular's
dependency injector won't work.  The solution is detailed in
src/app/injectable-decorator-workaround.ts  and is used in the app.

Any custom typescript decorators created by calling getClassModificationDecorator()
have been pre-transpiled into javascript files.  This is done to avoid an Angular
build error: 'Function calls are not supported in decorators...'.
