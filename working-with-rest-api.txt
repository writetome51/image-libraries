It's a private api.  Each request requires you submit a 'secret', which only I have.
Each request requires that you try to connect with a user account.  Each user 
record in the db has a 'loggedIn' property that, if set to false, will cause most api
requests to result in error.

The only requests to the api that can be successful when not logged in are:

GET request to 'user-exists'.
PATCH request to 'user-login'.
POST request to 'create-user'.

All other requests require being already logged in, with correct sessionID as proof.

When login is successful, the db updates these attributes in the user's record:
'loggedIn' = true, 'lastLoggedIn' = date/time of the login, and 'sessionID' = new ObjectId
converted to a string.
