The only requests to the api that can be successful when not logged in are:

GET request to 'user-exists'.
PATCH request to 'user-login'.
POST request to 'create-user'.

All other requests require being already logged in, with correct sessionID as proof.

When login is successful, the db updates these attributes in the user's document:
'loggedIn' = true, 'lastLoggedIn' = date/time of the login, and 'sessionID' = new ObjectId
converted to a string.  When this is finished, the updated document is sent back to us, we
encrypt its 'sessionID', and save it in the browser.
If the sessionID is deleted from the browser, they're considered logged out.
