This directory contains styles that are global to the app, as well as styles
applied to particular modules.
The stylesheets applied to particular modules have names ending in '.module.css'.
The reason those styles are here and not tied to specific components in those
modules is because these style instructions have module-wide scope.  They won't work in
component stylesheets.

To be included by the Angular bundler, the stylesheets here must be listed in the config
file  '{project-root}/angular.json'  at  projects.{project-name}.architect.build.options.styles
and  projects.{project-name}.architect.test.options.styles .
