This directory contains styles that are global to the app, as well as styles applied to
specific Angular Modules.
The stylesheets applied to specific Modules have names ending in '.module.css'.
The reason those styles are here and not tied to specific Components in those
Modules is because these styles have Module-wide scope.  They won't work in Component
stylesheets.

To be included by the Angular bundler, the stylesheets here must be listed in the
config file  /angular.json  at  projects.{project-name}.architect.build.options.styles
and projects.{project-name}.architect.test.options.styles.
