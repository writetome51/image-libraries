Each class/object in this directory is intended to be used as a singleton without requiring
instantiation, which is why some are declared as constants and others are static classes.
Each instance is intended to be referred to without the 'data' at the end, i.e. 'NewLibraryData' is
referred to as 'newLibrary'.

For any class/object which has a 'data' property: 'data' is exactly what the class/object
represents.  For example, ImageURLData, when referred to as an instance, will be imageURL, and a
reference to its 'data' property will be written as imageURL.data .  Here, 'data' is referring to
the image url itself.
