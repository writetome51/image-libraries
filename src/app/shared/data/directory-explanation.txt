Each class/object in this directory is intended to be used as a singleton without
requiring instantiation, which is why they're declared as either constants or static
classes.
Each instance, in use, is referred to without the 'data' at the end, i.e. 'NewLibraryData'
is referred to as 'newLibrary'.

For any class/object which has a 'data' property: 'data' is exactly what the class/object
represents.  For example, ImageURLData's 'data' property, when referred to, will look like
'imageURL.data', and is referring to the image url itself.
