This directory stores classes/objects that are simply data structures and have no behaviors.
Each class/object is named with 'Data' at the end as a convention, denoting that it's a data
structure.  Each class/object is intended to be used as a singleton, which is why some are
declared as constants instead of classes, and others are static classes (also because they
don't use any injected dependencies). Each singleton instance is intended to be referred to
without the 'data' at the end, i.e, 'NewLibraryData' is referred to as 'newLibrary'.

For any class/object which has a 'data' property: 'data' is exactly what the class/object
represents.  For example, ImageURLData, when referred to as an instance, will
be imageURL, and a reference to its 'data' property will be written as
imageURL.data .  Here, 'data' is referring to the image url itself.
